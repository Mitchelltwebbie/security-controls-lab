\# CC-002 — Vulnerability Scanning



\## Objective

Identify known vulnerabilities on in-scope lab assets and record findings in the vulnerability register.



\## Scope

In scope:

\- Assets listed in evidence/asset-inventory/inventory.md

\- Intentionally vulnerable local apps (DVWA / Juice Shop) hosted locally



Out of scope:

\- Any systems I do not own or do not have explicit permission to scan

\- Internet-wide scanning



\## Frequency

Monthly + after major configuration changes



\## Owner

Control Owner: Mitch (lab owner)



\## Procedure

1\) Confirm target is in-scope (listed in inventory)

2\) Run approved scanner against target (safe local target only)

3\) Export/save report with date

4\) Log findings into vulnerability register

5\) If critical finding: create remediation note



\## Evidence

\- reports/vuln-scan-YYYY-MM-DD.md

\- evidence/vulnerability-register/vuln-register.md

\- screenshot(s) saved in evidence/CC-002-vulnerability-scanning/



\## Exceptions

If scanner fails due to lab constraints, document failure reason + retry date.
