\# Windows Log Retrieval (Baseline)



\## Tool

Event Viewer (Windows Logs)



\## What I checked

\- I verified I can access Windows logs and filter by time/event type.



\## Filters used

\- Log: Security (or System)

\- Time range: Last 24 hours



\## Evidence

\- Screenshot: event-viewer-security-last-24h.png

\- Notes: I can filter by time range and export filtered events when needed.



\## Next step

Next week I will export a filtered set of events (EVTX) for a specific question (e.g., failed logons).
