# Windows Logging / Monitoring Notes

## Where logs live
- Tool: Event Viewer
- Path: Windows Logs → Security / System / Application

## Evidence captured
- Screenshot: (add filename)
- Example log category viewed: (Security or System)

## Notes

  - Reviewing system/service errors
  - Supporting incident-style writeups
