\# Audit-Ready Vulnerability \& Controls Lab (PCI/SOC2/ISO-ready)



\## Purpose

This repo documents my hands-on cybersecurity lab to build audit-ready fundamentals:

\- Controls thinking (what/why/how)

\- Evidence discipline (proof, not opinions)

\- Vulnerability management workflow (scan → triage → remediate → retest)



\## Safety / Scope Rules

\- I only test systems I personally own and control.

\- I only scan local intentionally vulnerable apps (e.g., OWASP Juice Shop) or local lab VMs.

\- No scanning external IPs, public websites, or anything I don’t own.



\## Repo Structure

\- `learning-log/` — weekly learning notes and reflections

\- `evidence-binder/` — audit-style evidence artifacts (screenshots, exports, notes)

\- `control-cards/` — one-page control definitions (objective, scope, frequency, evidence)

\- `reports/` — scan outputs and summaries

\- `tools/` — small scripts that automate evidence collection

\- `diagrams/` — scope diagrams, data flows, and boundary drawings



\## Cadence

\- Ship at least 1 meaningful artifact per week.

\- Keep everything reproducible and clearly scoped.
